# Menteeno's First Week: The 'Early Launch' Game

Menteeno's first week started with creating a game; a simple but very meaningful and challenging game. The story of this game emerged from situations we all experienced in the workplace — when a major, unexpected crisis turns everything upside down and then a series of domino-like events happen one after another.

## What was the game scenario?

Imagine a major marketing campaign like the nationwide campaigns of brands like "Divar" has been launched, but the final product wasn't ready for launch yet. Or a critical bug the night before release made the iOS app completely unlaunchable.

Fortunately in the real world, professional teams like Divar manage these crises with experience and calm. But at Menteeno, we decided to experience this scenario once as a game. Not just for simulation, but for real practice of soft skills, decision-making, and empathy in difficult situations.

## What were the roles?

To realistically recreate the crisis, we defined 5 key roles:

- **CTO** (Chief Technology Officer)
- **Technical Lead** (Technical Team Lead)
- **Marketing Lead** (Marketing Manager)
- **CEO** (Chief Executive Officer)
- **Customer Support Representative**

Later we realized that having two technical roles created imbalance, and in the final version, we replaced one of these roles with a **Financial Manager** to make the challenges more tangible.

## Game Structure

The game was held in two 30-minute rounds with a 10-minute break.

- **First Round:** Each team expressed their concerns. The main focus was on "active listening" and trying to understand the problem from other teams' perspectives.
- **Second Round:** Decision-making about the best solution. In this section, the CEO tried to help the team reach a conclusion through questions.

But...

## The Most Important Part of the Game: Break!

The break between two rounds wasn't just for tea and breathing! At this moment, the game took on a new dimension. We sent private messages to each person with unexpected scenarios that brought the game into a new phase:

- If the technical team was too confident, one of their key members would be sent on paternity leave!
- If the decision was made to cancel the campaign, we would bring investors or market competitors into the picture.

These events happened exactly at the moment when participants thought they had reached a solution and were drinking tea comfortably! This is where the game stopped being just a game.

## Results and Feedback

After several tests within our own team, we ran the game with the first group of participants. It was an amazing experience. The tense atmosphere, serious role-playing by the participants, and efforts to convince others made it one of Menteeno's most productive exercises.

For example, we noticed that some participants showed remarkable leadership qualities, some initially collapsed under pressure and then got back up, and some came up with creative solutions that we hadn't even thought of in the initial game design.

At the end of the game, each person rated themselves from 1 to 5 and gave their opinion about others' role-playing. Practicing giving and receiving feedback is exactly what we need at Menteeno and we strengthen it every week.

## Wait for Week Two

The first week was full of learning. The insights we gained from running the first game helped us design the second week's game — which we'll write about soon.

If you've read this far, thank you! Now it's your turn:

- How do you make decisions in critical work situations?
- What challenge made you say "well done to myself" afterwards?
- If you could go back, would you make a different decision?

And most importantly, give us **feedback** about this post. What did you like? What could be better? The practice of giving feedback starts right here ✨
